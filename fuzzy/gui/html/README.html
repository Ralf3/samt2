<h1>Fuzzy-Interpreter</h1>
<p>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
The program fuzzy was designed as a simple but fast algorithm. 
It can be used as part of other programs like fuzzy-controller, 
in simulation systems, etc. Only a few methods are implemented. 
It can deal with one to three inputs, the membership functions
for the inputs can be of type triangular ore trapeze. The output 
must be from type "singleton", that means crisp value. To use 
singletons as outputs is not so bad, because it is often sufficient 
and it is very fast. (you only need to calculate a weighted sum not a
integral for the defuzzification) In every rule the inputs are 
combined by the AND operation (if you need a OR you have to write
alternative rules). You can choose the minimum or 
product method as AND operation. The weight of a rule is calculated 
by multiplication of the result of the AND operation and a weight 
factor cf. So you will be able to control the rules in a different way.
The aggregation of all outputs of a rule uses the maximum operator. 
That means that aggregation only occurs ones for each output. 
The defuzzification process is simple and fast.

<h2>Input files and Example</h2>
<p>
The interpreter will be controlled by a fis file with the following 
structure:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Inputs
<li> Outputs
<li> Rules
</ul>
<p>
<h3> Inputs</h3>
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td> input
<td> input1
<td> 5
</tr>
<tr>
<td> member 
<td> small 
<td> triangular
</tr>
<tr>
<td> -1
<td> 10
<td> 20
</tr>
<tr>
<td> member
<td> small_medium
<td> triangular
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> 10
<td> 20 
<td> 30
</tr>
<tr>
<td> member
<td> medium
<td> triangular
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> 20
<td> 30 
<td> 40
</tr>
<tr>
<td> member
<td> medium_hot
<td> triangular
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> 30
<td> 40 
<td> 50
</tr>
<tr>
<td> member
<td> hot
<td> triangular
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> 40
<td> 50 
<td> 65
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The inputs must begin with the keyword "input", the name of the
input and the number of membership functions. There are up to three inputs
possible. The membership function can be of type trapeze or
triangular. For the trapeze type there are 4 numbers (the lower left
point, the upper left point, the upper right point and the lower right
point), for the triangular we only need 3 numbers.
<p>  
<h3>Outputs</h3>
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td> outputs
<td> temperature
<td> 5
</tr>
<tr>
<td> output 
<td> cold
<td> 10
</tr>
<tr>
<td> output
<td> cold_medium
<td> 25
</tr>
<tr>
<td> output
<td> medium
<td> 35
</tr>
<tr>
<td> output
<td> medium_hot
<td> 45
</tr>
<tr>
<td> output
<td> hot
<td> 60
</tr>
</table>
<p>
In that example are 5 outputs for temperature from cold to hot. 
<p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The rules combine the inputs with the outputs by numbering. In our
example we have only one input. That means that the rule consists only
of three columns: <b>input, output, cf</b>
<table>
<tr>
<td> rules
<td> 5
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 0
<td> 4
<td> 1.0
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 1
<td> 3
<td> 1.0
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2
<td> 2 
<td> 1.0
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 3
<td> 1
<td> 1.0
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 4
<td> 0
<td> 1.0
</tr>
</table>
<p>
This rule base is very simple. You can change the system by putting
rules in the rule base with different cf-factors. An other way to
change the system is to change the shape of the membership
function. Please check it.
<p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>
The example demonstrates a simple temperature controller with one input
and one output. It produces the following result:
<p>

<p>
You can see the saturation at the end of the input range (50..60) and
the piecewise linear parts. It is important to note that the input
range of the fuzzy-model must be greater then the inputs. That means
that the inputs in the example must be in the range (-0.99..64.99). 
<p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>
The system consists of following files:
<ul>
<li> input.h input.cpp
<li> output.h output.cpp
<li> member.h member.cpp
<li> rule.h rule.cpp
<li> fuzzy.h fuzzy.cpp
<li> main.cpp
<li> Makefile
<li> example files: 3.fis 2.fis wanne.fis wanne1.fis, wanne.txt as inputs
<li> README.html
<li> fuzzy.gif
</ul>
<p>
Get the program: 
<a href="http://www.zalf.de/ftp/pub/out/modell/fuzzy.tar.gz">Fuzzy_Interpreter</a>
<p>
Please unpack the fuzzy.tgz with:
<p>
<b>tar -zxvf fuzzy.tgz</b>
<p>
and type <b> make </b>
<p>
The main is only one example for the fuzzy. You can put in our system
and use it under terms of the GPL. It works fine under Linux but I
think it should be used under any kind of Unix. 
<p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>
Maybe that the program is useful for you, so I plan to develop a
graphical user interface to build the rule base. Please let me
know it. I use that program because it is simple and fast, so I'm able
to do many thousand fuzzy inferences per second. The program is easy
to extend for different membership function like bell shape functions,
but this would be lead to a slower program. If you need more then three inputs you
should split your problem in parts and combine it by a new fuzzy system.
<p>
Happy hacking
