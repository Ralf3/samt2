<h4 id="sec-1-1">&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>1.1 &nbsp;SAMT2 as Python Library</em></h4>
<div style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px">SAMT2 is a Python library, compiled with Cython. 
SAMT2 handles spatial raster data. <br>
It can read/write ASCII grids from ARCGIS but stores the data in a more 
efficient Hierarchical Data Format (HDF). <br>
HDF stores more than one file this allows to put all files for a project together.<br>
SAMT2 uses the numpy array as internal data format. This numpy array is the bridge to 
other Python models like scikit, mlpy, pywt and others. <br>
SAMT2 itself has a large set of grid calculation routines, 
for visualization, statistics, mathematical operations, blending techniques, etc. 
The most important feature of SAMT2 is the fuzzy modeling for spatial data.

<h4 id="sec-1-2">&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>1.2 &nbsp;SAMT2 as development toolbox</em></h4>
<div style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px; text-align:justify">
SAMT2 has a graphical user interface based on QT, which makes it easy 
to use SAMT2 as a modeling interface for spatial models. 
Each function can be checked and the result is easy to visualize 
in different ways. <br>
Together with the fuzzy toolbox or SADATO (it will be replaced with a Python implementation for 
the training of SVMs in the next version), SAMT2 can be to develop 
models efficiently. <br>It this release 1.0 of the GUI are included 
only basic calculations. The following versions can be enhanced 
with more specialized methods integrated according to the wishes of the users.

<h4 id="sec-1-3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>1.3 &nbsp;SAMT2 as Open Science Implementation</em></h4>
<div style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px; text-align:justify">
The idea of Open Science is to combine code, documentation and the 
interactive simulation in tool. This allows to develop models, 
to do simulations together with stakeholders.<br>
The basic for this is here ipython notebook. 
This Open Science approach is well suited for training so a interactive 
tutorial is implemented. You are invited to use it. 
Please open it with the following commands in a bash:<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left:80px; color:'red'">cd samt2/notebook; ipython notebook</div>
<div style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px"><br>
This opens the web browser "Firefox". Please select one example by 
following the link. You can run all cells ore step by step, 
can change parameters, can try to use your own data according to 
your needs and your skills.
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="sec-1-4">&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>1.4 &nbsp;SAMT2 in number crunching</em></h4>
<div style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px">
SAMT2 can be used as one of different Python modules even for 
cluster computing. <br>We use it for large spatial simulations within 
the cluster computer of the ZALF.
