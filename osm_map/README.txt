The module "map_map.py" is an application which combines SAMT2 with the
"osmviz": "http://cbick.github.io/osmviz/html/index.html" to make
a open streetmap map from a grid. This module is not well tested and
should be used with care. It works so far for the used gk5 projection
of our region and must be updated for other regions. The EPSG can be 
found in: "http://spatialreference.org/"

osm_object.py replaces the make_map.py. It is an object oriented implementation
which includes different geographic projections.
